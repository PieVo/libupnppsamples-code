= libupnpp sample programs

This repository has a bunch of small(ish) sample programs to help with
starting-up a libupnpp-based project. Some of them may be useful in their
own right but beware:

NOTE: none of the samples take a lot of care about managing memory because
they're of the 'run once and die' kind. Be careful about cleanup if you
integrate bits of code in a longer-running program.

The different samples are hopefully commented enough to be understandable
and useful.

== samples

=== src/uplistdir.cpp

Just list all devices and services on the local network, using the simple
libupnpp discovery 'traverse' method, which has to wait for the full
discovery window.

=== src/rdcvolume.cpp

Control the volume on an UPnP AV renderer, using the keyboard. This is a
simple demonstration of using a predefined libupnpp control class to control a
standard device. It uses discovery callbacks to connect to the device as
soon as it responds to search.

=== src/myrdcvolume.cpp

This is functionally the same as rdcvolume, but it defines its own service
control interface class. This is to show how you can do stuff without the
predefined control classes, and use libupnpp to control an arbitrary UPnP
device.

=== hello_src/hellodevice.cpp, hello_src/helloctl.cpp

This shows how to implement a "Hello World" device/service and the
corresponding control interface. Nothing in there that is not more
interestingly implemented in upmpdcli, but it is as simple as possible,
so certainly easier to understand.

=== upsend_src

A program to send an audio file to an UPnP AV renderer, without using a
Media Server. Can also send a 44100/16/2 stream read on stdin as a wav
file. The file description part (DIDL) is not too smart, but most
renderers don't seem to care. It uses libmicrohttpd to serve the audio file
to the renderer. Possibly could be improved and find a use.

=== src/multirdr.cpp

Shows that we can get events from multiple UPnP AV renderers.

=== src/upexplo.cpp

Has a whole bunch of more or less useful code snippets, accessing UPnP AV
Media Server and Renderer services.

=== src/ohradio.cpp, src/ohsender.cpp

Code to interface the OpenHome Radio and Sender services. Not sure that
this is good for anything...
